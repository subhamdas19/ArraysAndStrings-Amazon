Method 2 In this method, we need not to iterate array three times. We can find third largest in one traversal only.

Initialize first = a[0] and second = -INF, third = -INF
Iterate the array and compare each element with first.
If a[i] is greater than first then update all first, second and third:
third = second
second = first
first = arr[i]
Else compare arr[i] with second, if its greater than second, then update:
third = second
second = arr[i]
Else compare arr[i] with third, if its greater than third, then update:
third = arr[i]
Return third

    int first = arr[0], second = INT_MIN, third = INT_MIN; 
  
    // Traverse array elements to find the third Largest 
    for (int i = 1; i < arr_size ; i ++) 
    {

           then update first, second and third */
        if (arr[i] > first)

            third  = second; 
            second = first; 
            first  = arr[i]; 
        } 
  
        /* If arr[i] is in between first and second */
        else if (arr[i] > second) 
        { 
            third = second; 
            second = arr[i]; 
        }

        else if (arr[i] > third) 
            third = arr[i]; 
    } 
  
    printf("The third Largest element is %d\n", third); 
} 
  
/* Driver program to test above function */
int main() 
{ 
    int arr[] = {12, 13, 1, 10, 34, 16}; 
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
    thirdLargest(arr, n); 
    return 0; 
} 

Output :
The third Largest element is 13
