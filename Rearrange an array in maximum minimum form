Rearrange an array in maximum minimum form | Set 1
Given a sorted array of positive integers, rearrange the array alternately i.e first element should be maximum value, second minimum value, third second max, fourth second min and so on.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Output: arr[] = {7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4}

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output: arr[] = {6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3}

Expected time complexity: O(n).

Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to use an auxiliary array. We maintain two pointers one to leftmost or smallest element and other to rightmost or largest element. We more both pointers toward each other and alternatively copy elements at these pointers to an auxiliary array. Finally, we copy auxiliary array back to the original array.

Below image is a dry run of the above approach:

In this post a solution that requires O(n) time and O(1) extra space is discussed. The idea is to use multiplication and modular trick to store two elements at an index.

even index : remaining maximum element.
odd index  : remaining minimum element.
 
max_index : Index of remaining maximum element
            (Moves from right to left)
min_index : Index of remaining minimum element
            (Moves from left to right)

Initialize: max_index = 'n-1'
            min_index = 0  
            max_element = arr[max_index] + 1 //can be any element which is more than the maximum value in array

For i = 0 to n-1            
    If 'i' is even
       arr[i] += arr[max_index] % max_element * max_element 
       max_index--     
    ELSE // if 'i' is odd
       arr[i] +=  arr[min_index] % max_element * max_element
       min_index++
How does expression “arr[i] += arr[max_index] % max_element * max_element” work ?
The purpose of this expression is to store two elements at index arr[i]. arr[max_index] is stored as multiplier and “arr[i]” is stored as remainder. For example in {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}, max_element is 10 and we store 91 at index 0. With 91, we can get original element as 91%10 and new element as 91/10.

Below implementation of above idea:

// C++ program to rearrange an array in minimum 
// maximum form 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Prints max at first position, min at second position 
// second max at third position, second min at fourth 
// position and so on. 
void rearrange(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    // initialize index of first minimum and first 
    // maximum element 
    int max_idx = n - 1, min_idx = 0; 
  
    // store maximum element of array 
    int max_elem = arr[n - 1] + 1; 
  
    // traverse array elements 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
        // at even index : we have to put maximum element 
        if (i % 2 == 0) { 
            arr[i] += (arr[max_idx] % max_elem) * max_elem; 
            max_idx--; 
        } 
  
        // at odd index : we have to put minimum element 
        else { 
            arr[i] += (arr[min_idx] % max_elem) * max_elem; 
            min_idx++; 
        } 
    } 
  
    // array elements back to it's original form 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        arr[i] = arr[i] / max_elem; 
} 
  
// Driver program to test above function 
int main() 
{ 
    int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }; 
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); 
  
    cout << "Original Arrayn"; 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        cout << arr[i] << " "; 
  
    rearrange(arr, n); 
  
    cout << "\nModified Array\n"; 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        cout << arr[i] << " "; 
    return 0; 
} 

Output :
Original Array
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Modified Array
9 1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5
