Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum

Only DOne the recursive approach and not done the DP problem.
Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) – sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example:

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11        
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE” first, before moving on to the solution.
This problem is mainly an extension to the Dynamic Programming| Set 18 (Partition Problem).

Recursive Solution
The recursive approach is to generate all possible sums from all the values of array and to check which solution is the most optimal one.
To generate sums we either include the i’th item in set 1 or don’t include, i.e., include in set 2.

// A Recursive C program to solve minimum sum partition 
// problem. 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Function to find the minimum sum 
int findMinRec(int arr[], int i, int sumCalculated, int sumTotal) 
{ 
    // If we have reached last element.  Sum of one 
    // subset is sumCalculated, sum of other subset is 
    // sumTotal-sumCalculated.  Return absolute difference 
    // of two sums. 
    if (i==0) 
        return abs((sumTotal-sumCalculated) - sumCalculated); 
  
  
    // For every item arr[i], we have two choices 
    // (1) We do not include it first set 
    // (2) We include it in first set 
    // We return minimum of two choices 
    return min(findMinRec(arr, i-1, sumCalculated+arr[i-1], sumTotal), 
               findMinRec(arr, i-1, sumCalculated, sumTotal)); 
} 
  
// Returns minimum possible difference between sums 
// of two subsets 
int findMin(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    // Compute total sum of elements 
    int sumTotal = 0; 
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) 
        sumTotal += arr[i]; 
  
    // Compute result using recursive function 
    return findMinRec(arr, n, 0, sumTotal); 
} 
  
// Driver program to test above function 
int main() 
{ 
    int arr[] = {3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1}; 
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
    cout << "The minimum difference between two sets is "
         << findMin(arr, n); 
    return 0; 
} 

Output:
The minimum difference between two sets is 1
Time Complexity:

All the sums can be generated by either 
(1) including that element in set 1.
(2) without including that element in set 1.
So possible combinations are :-  
arr[0]      (1 or 2)  -> 2 values
arr[1]    (1 or 2)  -> 2 values
.
.
.
arr[n]     (2 or 2)  -> 2 values
So time complexity will be 2*2*..... *2 (For n times),
that is O(2^n).
